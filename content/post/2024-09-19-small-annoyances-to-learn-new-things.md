For me this is more of a meta post, as it's mostly the rediscovery of a personal preference of mine. The best way to learn something for me is doing it while scrambling to figure out how it works and asking for help when stuck. As an example doing a carbage-run through England / Wales with a car I know next to nothing about and lacking understanding of how it works. 

When we started driving on the first day, the engine light started blinking, no good indication of what's wrong but an engine in safe mode trying to protect it's integrity. (A faulty ignition coil I would later learn...). Annoyed and somewhat unstrustful to our car we drove on.. trying to figure out what's wrong. We fixed it the next day with wonderfull advice and I learned a lot during the week of travel!

Yesterday I figured I would deal with another, albeit minor annoyance of mine. All our towels have at most 1 eye through which you can hang it on a hook... I spend at least a couple of seconds (Yes, I know, I said minor!) every day trying to find the corner where it is attached. To solve this I had to dig out our sewing machine, thread it and figure out how to sew (which I had learned a bit from my mom years earlier). An hour later and a couple of youtube videos later I got a bobbin installed, threaded the wire and got on to sewing one eye to each corner.

And just the pure joy of using any corner to hang it once you're done is awesome! I can highly recommend this!
