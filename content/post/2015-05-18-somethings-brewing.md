And it's beer! Well it's stored now and bubbling away! Yesterday afternoon I've brewed my first batch of beer. With the gear and knowledge of a friend, we manufactured 48 liters of pale ale. The sunny afternoon also was a perfect opportunity for my new camera, so I took some tests shots. Here's the brewery in my backyard:

The recipe we decided on included star-anise and lemongrass. Sadly the coriander seeds got lost and we skipped those. Hopefully the taste will turn out great! First tasting was pretty good! Here we are happy with the progress:

In about 2 weeks the fermentation should be completed and the bottling would commence! Some more pictures will follow with the end result, keep you posted!
