Not only does this title sound good, it's pretty awesome too. In the past weeks I've been mixing different methods of creation to end up with an perfect product. The problem arised when I was renovating my kitchen. We were tiling the backsplash of the kitchen and we needed a couple of outlets. We however didn't want to sacrifice the aesthetics of the tiling and having an outlet cross a tile didn't look right to us.

So what did I do to solve it? First make a drawing of the tile with support for the outlets. A digital replica of what I wanted was the first step. Next printing it out and smoothing it. After smoothing, it's time to make a negative mold. With the help of the [Mayku Multiplier](https://mayku.me/multiplier) that's 10 minutes of work. All set and done, I've got two molds ready for ceramics!

Ofcourse, I looked around and asked tile manufacturers if they sold such a tile, but since it's custom work they don't. I'm stuck with a negative mold and can easily replicate it.. The only hard thing to do was the glazing.. since that's pretty hard to match..

This was a perfect project to get started with the Multiplier. I've been tinkering and exploring on how to use it for [wandering.computer](https://wandering.computer) as well, more news on that soon!
