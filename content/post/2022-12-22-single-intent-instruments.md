I've [written before on single purpose tools](https://jplattel.nl/post/2021-09-23-single-purpose-tools/), and this year I've been thinking more about it and somehow it didn't feel right. The purpose of a device or tool should not be single minded. For example, the _intent_ of a typewriter is to write, but you can write whatever you want, whether it's poetry or propaganda. The purpose of the single action does differ from action to action. So I have to rephrase the idea a bit.

I came up with **single intent instruments**, and both [wandering.computer](https://wandering.computer) and another project I've been working on fit in that idea. The intent of the instrument is singular, for example you reach for a typewriter if you want to type. You won't get distracted by ads or do something else if the intent is clear. A computer or phone are contradictory of a single intent, it doesn't really matter what you want, you can most of the time do it on the device itself. 

The single intent also allows for focus and forces you to think beforehand about what you are to embark upon. And what about creativity? Is it fostered by setting an intention, or does it hurt when limited too much? If you're just starting out with a new instrument, how does learning fit into the intent? Can you just play around? Or is it too vague? There's more fundamental things here, you cannot correct mistakes on a physical typewriter, but it leaves a mark...

Too many things are made to do too many things at once, (and fail at it most of the time) is there a place for _single intent instruments_?
