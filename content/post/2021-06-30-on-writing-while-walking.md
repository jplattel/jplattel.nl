There are numerous examples of writers, creative people, historians and other who found that walking is a benificial activity when it comes to writing. The act of simple moving forward and letting the body and mind wander seems to work for a lot of persons. I only recently started to write (or type as we'll call it in this anthropocene), one of the main points that did it for me had to do with the tools. The mind is only as sharp as the pencil, but if there is no pencil at all how do you even start? For me it had to do with two things, this blog and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). For just over a year now I've started journaling and kept at it! For the first time ever! My handwriting still sucks, but typing speed increased and my vocabulary in english expanded more and more..

Walking is something I've been doing over the last 10 years... From long hikes to just walking around the neighboorhood as a daily exercise. Combining both walking and typing has been something I've been dreaming of a while, still unsure whether how I could make it work. Instead of keeping it a dream I decided to spend some of my time developing [the keyboard](https://jplattel.nl/post/2021-04-19-finalizing-hardware-for-a-wearable-keyboard/) that would allow me to do so.

For sure it's not going to be perfect, there are still loads of ideas on the drawing board, but I had to stop at a point in which a prototype would be enough for me to validate it for me personally.

While we're on the topic of typing, people have been exploring other ways of working which do not start with a desk. Several people wrote on [supine computing](https://mgsloan.com/posts/supine-computing/) which mostly implies doing work while lying down.
