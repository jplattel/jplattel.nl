This project has been in the making for quite a couple of months, but since it's finished I thought it would be cool to write a post about it! We've been looking for a replacement of our wine rack that was mounted above our sofa. We wanted something more green, but didn't have any idea what it should be. Until I came about this [tiling planter](https://www.printables.com/model/1378199-vaso-de-planta-gota-de-agua/files) on [Printables](https://www.printables.com). 

I redesigned the part to be a bit more spacious and have a bigger opening for the smaller plants to grow out of. I've also [uploaded my remix to Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1568781-tiling-wall-planter). Then I got started printing over 20 of them with terracotta coloured PLA:

_I printed 2 at the time with a brim to have a bit more bed adhesion... Otherwise they would remove themselves from the build plate half way... 👀_

We then brushed/coated them all with 2 layers of epoxy to make them more water resistant (also keeping the PLA intact for as long as possible)

For mounting them I created a backplate with mounting holes that matched the previous wine rack. We then screwed each planter in its place and put in the plants. Pretty happy with the result (although it is a pain to water haha! 😛).
