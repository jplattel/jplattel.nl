I got a bit [annoyed](/post/2016-01-29-on-solving-annoying-things/) about checking the mailbox we get from our government here in the Netherlands. Thus I wrote a little script that would do it for me and press the forward to my email button.

It's open-source on [Github](https://github.com/jplattel/berichtenbox-forwarder), but not supported any more.
