[ical2roam](https://ical2roam.jplattel.nl/) is a small web application that lets you convert iCal exports to a JSON file that can be used to import into Roam Research. That way you can import an entire calendar full of events into [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) while creating just a single node along each daily note.

You can customize the text for the events node and filter on date-ranges or text. This allows you to customize what you want to import into Roam Research

The usage is really simple:

1. Create an export of your iCalendar to `.ics` format.
2. Upload the `.ics` file to [ical2roam](https://ical2roam.jplattel.nl/).
3. Specify the events node text (and include optional hashtags).
4. Optionally filter the events and download the `.json` file,
5. In [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), click on import and select the `.json` file.
6. Check if the preview matches what you expect.
7. Bonus tip, you can try it out with a smaller amount of events first! Filter on a smaller date range!
