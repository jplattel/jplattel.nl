In 2018 - 2020 I am one of the ambassadors for the Digital Society School located in Amsterdam. I'm giving guest lectures & workshops (together with [Kees](https://ikbenke.es/)). 

If it's about data, Quantified Self or the ethics, privacy or design, we tend to cover everything and focus on creativity, useful methods & crtical thinking.
