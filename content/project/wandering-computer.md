I'm creating a wearable writing companion made for moving. I dislike the idea most of my work is defined by the desk I'm sitting at. What if we could wield a keyboard that would let us write without any distractions. No procrastination, phone calls or other means just writing while walking.

That's the main idea. I've finished a couple of prototypes and I'm now working towards a new version of the PCB that's on the inside. This might turn into a product in the future.

I've also made a [couple](http://localhost:1313/post/2022-07-24-progress-wearable-keyboard-wandering-computer/) of [posts](http://localhost:1313/post/2021-04-19-finalizing-hardware-for-a-wearable-keyboard/) on the development on this [blog](http://localhost:1313/tags/keyboard/) so far!
