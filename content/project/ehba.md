I'm often traveling by public transport here in the Netherlands. An OV-Chipkaart is required, but the current interface on the cards lack any way of gaining insights about your travel. If you want to select a subscription, on what data do you base your choice? 

I set out to solve this with a little Svelte application to get started with this technology. The backend is running on serverless and only does the calculations.

Have a look at [ehba.app](https://ehba.app)!
