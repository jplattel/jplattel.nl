I'm often traveling by public transport here in the Netherlands. An OV-Chipkaart is required, but the current interface on the cards lack any way of gaining insights about your travel. If you want to select a subscription, on what data do you base your choice? 

I set out to solve this with a little Svelte application to get started with this technology. The backend is running on serverless and only does the calculations.

This project is [archived on Github](https://github.com/jplattel/ehba) and currently not supported any more.
