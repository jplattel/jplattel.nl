I'm developing a small app for Mac OS X that allows me to view a series of columns next to each other, while preserving a specific sort (per column). Currently Finder does not allow this as it applies the sorting to each instance that's open. Dragging things from one pane to another is also annoying. Fun fact: I've mostly been doing this with the help of ChatGPT since I'm not that familiar with SwiftUI! 

I might release the source-code or bundle it in an app to download in the future, for now this is mostly for personal use!
