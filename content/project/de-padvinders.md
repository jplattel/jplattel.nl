My first real project that got a bit out of hand and developed in a business while I was a student. Together with 4 other friends I helped people with working smarter on their computer, basically doing as Seth Godin said: 

> Go find a geek. Someone who understands Gmail, Outlook, and other basic tools. Pay him to sit next to you for an hour and watch you work. Then say, 'tell me five ways I can save an hour a day.' Whatever you need to pay for this service, it will pay for itself in a week. ~ Seth Godin

The business was good for more then a couple of years. But in the end our interest in coaching people personally faded. Ah well. onto the next adventure!
