üëã Hey there! I'm Joost, and I'd like to call myself an _<abbr title="Extra and/or expendable">auxiliary</abbr> technologist_. 

I facilitate organisations and individuals with technology. The daunting task to strategize in a changing world is made hard by the lack of transparency and previous experiences. I explore the fringes of new technology and keep a wide network of people to draw from different avenues.

By building prototypes, tinkering and iterating publicly we can discover what may lie ahead. Whether you would like physical device that measures something or an headless API that serves your customers, I'll be delighted to help you out!

My [clients](/client) range from individuals to startups and even the government or large organizations. People recommend my for my unique combination of curiousity with applied solutions. Wondering what else I do? Have a look at my other [projects](/project). 

In my other time I run my mostly monthly newsletter, [The Curious Corner of the Internet](https://curiouscorner.nl) and our small brewery [Brouwerij Nooitgedacht](http://brouwerijnooitgedacht.nl/) with friends.</a>

## Work with me

If you (or your organization) want to explore the possiblities of working together [get in touch](/contact) with me. People recommend me for my unique combination of curiousity and applied solutions. 

Most of the work I do consists of consulting and/or development. In the case of consulting, my curiousity and wide network provides me with a wide variety of solutions. 

When developing a technical solution for a client my preferred tools are `Python` / `Django` / `FastAPI` / `Javascript` / `Node` / `AI` / `llms`  and platforms like `AWS`, `GCP` or `Digital Ocean`. Hardware related things are mostly done on the `MicroPython` & `CircuitPython` framework and mostly run on `ESP` or `Pico` related chips.

I'm also well known with small scall manufacturing tools like `FDM` & `resin` printers, vacuumforming, soldering and parametric design work in `Fusion360`. As well as basic PCB design and electronics knowledge.

_On a sidenote, I aim to work at most 2 days a week for a single client. This allows for enough cross-overs to keep things fresh and evolving. Ofcourse exceptions can be made in consultation._
