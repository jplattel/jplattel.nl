I assisted [Stef Veldhuis](https://stefveldhuis.com) on technological components and realization of his artworks. 

## [Microcodex](https://stefveldhuis.com/MC_LR)

Possibly the first artwork in The Netherlands with a GMO (Genetically Modified Organism). An e-coli bacteria carrying a verse in it's DNA is carefully kept within the artwork itself. I was responsible for the technology keeping the environment within the bioreactor optimal for the organism to grow. A Raspberry Pi Pico is used as a microcontroller that reads sensor input and drives output.

## Telling the Bees

Bees are archivists, storing information about their environment within the hive. What would happen if you let a hive of bees control a archival space? A beehive full of sensors is used as input to control an archive. Parameters include temperature, light & humidity. All controlled with a Raspberry Pi.
