For [Nolostcapital](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/business/people/academic/phoebe-moore) I build a tool that lets them put out questionnaires for specific goals towards well-being and HR. The tool offers direct insights from all the results from those questionnaires, enabling organizations to quickly act. 

The backend service was done in _python_ & _Django_ and the front-end in _Vue_.
