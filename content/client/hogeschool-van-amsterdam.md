For the [Amsterdam University of Applied Science](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/) I've build an application that let's people discover & connect with Talent initiatives within the Amsterdam Metropolitan Region. The goal of the application is to bridge the gap between organisations and talent initiatives.

The entire stack of the web application is based on modern technology & build entirely with _javascript_. The backend is done with [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and the frontend run with [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) & [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
