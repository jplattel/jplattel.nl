For the [Amsterdam University of Applied Science](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/) I've build a application that let's people discover & connect with Talent initiatives within the Amsterdam Metropolitan Region.

The entire stack of the web application is based on modern technology & build entirely with _javascript_. 

The backend is done with [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and the frontend run with [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) & [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
