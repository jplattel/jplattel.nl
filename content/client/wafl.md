For Maurice van Dinther and [Wafl.nu](https://wafl.nu) I developed several questionnaire tools, this allowed him to get more clients or create something that his clients could use. All of those tools were build with [_Svelte_](https://svelte.dev/). If a backend was required it was build with [_Chalice_](https://aws.github.io/chalice/index.html).
