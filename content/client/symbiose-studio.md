Working with [Bertrand from Symbiose Studio](https://symbiose.studio/) I've build the technical side of Intimate Implant. Three objects, each representing an regenerative implant. Three stories that investigate ethics, sacrifice and our relation to technology that disappears. [Learn more at Symbiose Studio](https://symbiose.studio/projects/intimate-implant/).

Each object carries a microcontroller that is running `circuitpython` and a speaker that allows telling stories (or by headphones). The LEDs in combination with a accelerometer creates an object that invites persons to interact with the objects. Closing the gap between the abdstract idea of an implant and having it inside your body.

Here is what Bertrand has to say about me for this project:

> Joost is an indispensable technologist in my projects. He oversees the technical realization from start to finish and actively contributes ideas on the best form, materials, and techniques. What makes him special to me is that he not only has all the technical skills required but also has an eye for design and usability. As a result, the technology always aligns with the intended experience. Additionally, Joost offers realistic pricing and is willing to go the extra mile to achieve the desired outcome. What I appreciate most about him is his involvement: he is not someone who just executes tasksâ€” with Joost, you gain an enthusiastic project partner who stands beside you and is genuinely engaged with the project.

The objects are now a part of [the collection Posthuman](https://designmuseum.nl/derde-verdieping/posthuman/) of [Design Museum Den Bosch](https://designmuseum.nl/) and might be exhibited.
