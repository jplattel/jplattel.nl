Working with [Bertrand from Symbiose Studio](https://symbiose.studio/) I've build the technical side of Intimate Implant. Three objects, each representing an regenerative implant. Three stories that investigate ethics, sacrifice and our relation to technology that disappears. [Learn more at Symbiose Studio](https://symbiose.studio/).

Each object carries a microcontroller that is running `micropython` and a speaker that allows telling stories (or by headphones). The LEDs in combination with a accelerometer creates an object that invites persons to interact with the objects.
