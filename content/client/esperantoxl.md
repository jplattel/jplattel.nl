For [EsperantoXL](https://esperantoxl.nl/) I make custom solutions to extend the possibilities of no-code applications with the help of Serverless & computing providers like AWS & Azure. 

This solution allows for processing million lines of codes in a unsupported datafile, analyze & run queries on it and return it through a callback towards the no-code platform once again. Most of the implementations are based on _Python_.
