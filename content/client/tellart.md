I've worked with [Tellart](https://www.tellart.com/) on the [Dinner in 2050](https://www.tellart.com/projects/dinner-in-2050) installation for the UAE Pavilion. For COP28 the goal of this installation is to make people think about climate change in a very personal way.

Visitors would be asked to tell about their favorite dish which would then be transformed into a dish in 2050 with an ingredient swapped out that would have the most impact on climate change.

I've mostly worked on the technical side, working with AI like Whisper, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models. Connecting it all together while using Python, Touchdesigner and various protocols.
