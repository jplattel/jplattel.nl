With Maurice van Dinther from [wafl.nu](https://wafl.nu) I've created a monitoring/questionnaire tool for the KSU. This allows them to gain insights into how their teams are functioning. The application is build with Django and uses [SSO]() to seamlessly allow users to gather data. The data is shown in dashboards with [Chart.js]().
