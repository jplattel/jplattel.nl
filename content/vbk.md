For Van Benthem en Keulen I worked together with Arianove to implement a large language model chat interface that runs on Azure Static Web Applications, using their own Azure endpoint allows VBK to keep their data safely theirs. The custom front-end is made with [Svelte 5]() and [Tailwind](), hosted as a Static Web App (SWA) on Azure.
