      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been journaling for a thousand days using Obsidian. A habit I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a long time. Until I found Obsidian I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it work, but it does now! In this post I wanted to reflect on my daily notes and some ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the last few days.
If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about my current daily note template, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a gist on Github.</description>

      <title>Personal Taxonomy (Part 2)</title>

      <description>In the previous part I highlighted how I managed my notes in folders. In this part I would like to explain a bit more on how make the decision between tags &amp;amp; a linked note.
For people unfamiliar with the difference, this is a #tag and a bi-directional linked notes works like so: [[Note Title]]. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;s implemented in Obsidian. It might be different in other tools, but the ideas can stay the same.</description>

      <description>While explaining and introducing Obsidian to people I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that the free form way of setup allows for so much flexibility. This results in an big amount of questions on how you would structure the links, tags and your vault. And while there are some solutions like PARA or LYT, I think the best system is the one you create yourself.
One of the main reasons is that you&amp;rsquo;ll learn a lot about how you think about the data relevant to you.</description>

      <title>Rhizomatic notetaking</title>

      <description>The past few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring the philosophy of Deleuze &amp;amp; Guattari in which I focus mostly on the rhizome. As the rhizome doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a start or end, grows from within itself and into multiple directions I saw similarities on how I started to take more notes recently.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my own Obsidian Clipper chrome extension to clip short amounts of text and those are automatically tagged with ðŸŒ±.</description>

      <title>Workspaces instead of applications</title>

      <description>As most of my work I do lives on my computer one of the main things I do is switch applications. When referencing something on the internet and applying it in a editor or copy-pasting an address from a contact to google maps search, most of it is done while switching applications.
For some switches the friction is reduced, for example lookups through Alfred.app or pretty printing some JSON with jq.</description>

      <title>January: Project Month</title>
      <link>https://jplattel.nl/post/2021-01-31-closing-january/</link>

      <description>Before the start of this month, I made a commitment to myself to focus all of my attention to personal projects. Just in between clients I could focus purely on my own things! And when January got started, an idea started in my mind that I wanted to take 3 projects to make some progres on.
As it turned out, I worked on way more than 3 projects, still did some work for clients, but looking back at this month, I surely achieved making significant progres on at least 3 of my projects.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just published my first plugin for Obsidian! As a huge fan of the software the possibility of writing your own plugins to work with the data you create is just awesome! I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Obsidian for over 8 months now and one of the first things I created was the clipper.
Since a few months Obsidian now allows users to write plugins in Typescript. While I&amp;rsquo;m not that versed in the Typescript/Javascript verse I did manage to write my first plugin!</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m quite a heavy user of Obsidian I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some of my scripts I&amp;rsquo;ve written for it. Please note that all of the scripts make use of Keyboard Meastro as a way to activate them and some of them use javascript automation within Mac OS X. So it&amp;rsquo;s Apple only for now.
Within Obsidian I&amp;rsquo;m keeping a folder in which there are files that are used as a templates.</description>

      <title>In search for a knowledge system</title>

      <description>For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a system which would augment my own thinking with the help of the computer. One of the main promises of a digital life is things could more efficient. Or easily shareable and more resilient (Once you have backups..). For a meriad of reasons the switch should be obvious but for the most of us, that&amp;rsquo;s not what we experience. Why is that?
I started of with just Word documents in folders.</description>
