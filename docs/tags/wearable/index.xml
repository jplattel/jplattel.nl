      <description>In a previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve shown physical prototypes of a wearable keyboard I&amp;rsquo;m developing. The goal of this keyboard is to provide me with a way to type while walking or just standing/sitting somewhere. I want to blind-type notes while keeping my attention at other things.
Most of the comments I get have to do with why I don&amp;rsquo;t use dictation. There are several reasons for that, namely I&amp;rsquo;m taking my notes bilingual (English &amp;amp; Dutch) and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to shout around my ideas while being nearby other people, as this might be annoying or even rude&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I have been thinking about the bandwidth problem we face with computer interaces. When typing with a keyboard or dictating trough speech, the computer cannot keep up with a stream of thoughts. Our bandwidth is limited by our output.
One of the more future forwards solutions is Neuralink, but to me it seems like quite an invasive solution, not without any risks..
Often times we may find solutions for this in a different space, in this case, a pointer can be found in the legal system.</description>

      <title>Exploring wearable input devices</title>

      <description>For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring the internet for input devices. From keyboards to voice or gestured controlled ways to get thoughts out of my head as fast/good as it can be possible. I wanted to dive deeper into why this is important to me and why I&amp;rsquo;m interested in this space.
Traditionally pen &amp;amp; paper was the solution that was flexible enough. But it lacked the searchability and ways of exploring it on different tangents.</description>
