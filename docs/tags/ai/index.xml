      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Tellart on the Dinner in 2050 installation for the UAE Pavilion. For COP28 the goal of this installation is to make people think about climate change in a very personal way.
Visitors would be asked to tell about their favorite dish which would then be transformed into a dish in 2050 with an ingredient swapped out that would have the most impact on climate change.

      <description>ChatGPT is all the rage nowadays. Personally I&amp;rsquo;ve used it quite a few times and professionally as a software developer it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to use. I don&amp;rsquo;t fear for my job/knowledge (yet!) as it&amp;rsquo;s mostly integrations and not of the shelf code&amp;hellip; (I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried the hardware space in Chat GPT yet&amp;hellip;.. paperclips might be optimized..) ✌️
To figure out how useful it might be for me, I embarked on a journey together with ChatGPT to build a piece of software that would solve issues that I&amp;rsquo;d had with the Mac OS X Finder for a while.</description>
