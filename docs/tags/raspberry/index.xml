      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m no stranger to making keyboards and while I&amp;rsquo;m tinkering with creating a wearable keyboard I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon many other builds of people that do interesting stuff.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been browsing the usual reddits (r/mk, r/ErgoMechKeyboards and the likes) I stumbled upon a nice looking project that would get me into ortholinear&amp;hellip; I wanted a keyboard different enough that it&amp;rsquo;s worth building. So I ended up with the VT-40.

I think a certain part boredom is necessary to facilitate ideas and other serendipitous discoveries. However there might be times, in which you would like for the pure boredom to disappear.</description>
