      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about the bandwidth problem we face with computer interaces. When typing with a keyboard or dictating trough speech, the computer cannot keep up with a stream of thoughts. Our bandwidth is limited by our output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the more future forwards solutions is &lt;a href=&#34;https://neuralink.com/&#34;&gt;Neuralink&lt;/a&gt;, but to me it seems like quite an invasive solution, not without any risks..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often times we may find solutions for this in a different space, in this case, a pointer can be found in the legal system. During a lawsuit a minute taker (sometimes even multiple) is the person who tries to log all the speech done by any of the parties present. The typing speed required for this is immense and one of the solutions is combining shorthand or stenography with a chorded keyboard. This results in a higher output speed allowing the minute taker to keep up with the tempo of speech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring the internet for input devices. From keyboards to voice or gestured controlled ways &lt;em&gt;to get thoughts out of my head as fast/good as it can be possible&lt;/em&gt;. I wanted to dive deeper into why this is important to me and why I&amp;rsquo;m interested in this space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally pen &amp;amp; paper was the solution that was flexible enough. But it lacked the searchability and ways of exploring it on different tangents. Right now we&amp;rsquo;re mostly digital and rely on our keyboards to create mainly text.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
