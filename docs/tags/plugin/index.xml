      <description>Before the start of this month, I made a commitment to myself to focus all of my attention to personal projects. Just in between clients I could focus purely on my own things! And when January got started, an idea started in my mind that I wanted to take 3 projects to make some progres on.
As it turned out, I worked on way more than 3 projects, still did some work for clients, but looking back at this month, I surely achieved making significant progres on at least 3 of my projects.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just published my first plugin for Obsidian! As a huge fan of the software the possibility of writing your own plugins to work with the data you create is just awesome! I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Obsidian for over 8 months now and one of the first things I created was the clipper.
Since a few months Obsidian now allows users to write plugins in Typescript. While I&amp;rsquo;m not that versed in the Typescript/Javascript verse I did manage to write my first plugin!</description>

      <description>As someone who creates shortcuts and automations all the time I often get asked questions about certain things to automate that aren&amp;rsquo;t really like the things I personally do.
Most of the time this has to do with web applications and the barrier of create an entire app (if there even is an API available) is way to high based on price or time spend. More recently I discovered that an easy way of packaging and shipping things for individuals to larger groups could often be in the form of a Chrome extension.</description>
