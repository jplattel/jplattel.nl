      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to build a Pingo clock for quite some time. Finally having some time available between projects I had most components on hand. With the exception for the bigger LED rings. And I also wanted to have the clock run on Circuitpython instead of Arduino. So I designed a smaller one, with only 7 led rings instead of 9. This also allowed me to print more parts, for example the diffusion screen is printed as well as a custom USB-c charging backplate.</description>

      <description>While developing the OV Klok I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring how small trinkets and other technological utilities can be configured. Most of the time, it&amp;rsquo;s either trough a captive portal, a self-served webserver or editing a configuration file. Both options aren&amp;rsquo;t really user friendly to me&amp;hellip;
The captive portal is fails at times and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work if you have a custom network configuration. The self served webpage requires a user to type in an address or IP, that&amp;rsquo;s only accessible in a specific mode.</description>

      <description>Sovn (previously known as Jawsaver) creates smart earbuds to stop teeth grinding &amp;amp; clenching. Bruxism is a problem and to solve that I was asked to create several prototypes of mechanics to see what&amp;rsquo;s the most interesting strategy to develop into a product.
All prototypes where supported with a dynamic earbud platform that let&amp;rsquo;s a user test different mechanics. Arduino&amp;rsquo;s, micropython, 3D printing and rapid prototyping are things that we&amp;rsquo;re used in this development proces.</description>
