      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Tellart on the Dinner in 2050 installation for the UAE Pavilion. For COP28 the goal of this installation is to make people think about climate change in a very personal way.
Visitors would be asked to tell about their favorite dish which would then be transformed into a dish in 2050 with an ingredient swapped out that would have the most impact on climate change. Over 18.000 meals were generated by the visitors.</description>
