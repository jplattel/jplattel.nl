      <description>&lt;p&gt;At one of the stands of a flea market during Kingsday here in the Netherlands, I found an old plane. And for only 2 euro I couldn&amp;rsquo;t leave it behind. I took it on me to restore it to its former glory. First step, dismantle the broken off handle, removing any drops of paint and cleaning the chisel from all the rust. I also took measurements of the old handle and started designing that in Fusion 360. I love it how I just started using that and more projects come my way that need some kind of modeling. I also had to remove a big bolt that was mounted up front:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
