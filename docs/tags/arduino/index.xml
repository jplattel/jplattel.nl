      <description>Sovn (previously known as Jawsaver) creates smart earbuds to stop teeth grinding &amp;amp; clenching. Bruxism is a problem and to solve that I was asked to create several prototypes of mechanics to see what&amp;rsquo;s the most interesting strategy to develop into a product.
All prototypes where supported with a dynamic earbud platform that let&amp;rsquo;s a user test different mechanics. Arduino&amp;rsquo;s, micropython, 3D printing and rapid prototyping are things that we&amp;rsquo;re used in this development proces.</description>

      <description>My girlfriend loves to solves sudoku&amp;rsquo;s and most of the time she&amp;rsquo;s doing so on her iPhone.. As a belated birthday gift I made her a custom sudoku-keyboard with just 9 keys. Who needs more if you just want to do a sudoku right?
This was a perfect opportunity for me to dive some more into hardware and especially bluetooth things&amp;hellip; The entire body is 3D printed and has threaded inserts with M3 screws and basic keycaps.</description>
