      <description>I am trying to publish my blogposts in English to reach a wider public. However since English is my second language please forgive me my spelling errors.
Since reading about self-tracking I was fascinated by GPS location and geospatial analysis. As it turns out â€¦. experiments had been done before and I wanted to experience what you could do with the data.
I wondered if it were possible for me recreate this, using my less then basic programming skills and no more utilities then my iPhone.</description>
