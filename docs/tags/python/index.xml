      <description>For EsperantoXL I make custom solutions to extend the possibilities of no-code applications with the help of Serverless &amp;amp; computing providers like AWS &amp;amp; Azure.
This solution allows for processing million lines of codes in a unsupported datafile, analyze &amp;amp; run queries on it and return it through a callback towards the no-code platform once again. Most of the implementations are based on Python.</description>

      <description>For Dropper I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented improvements for their Django application. Dropper was a startup that was into last-mile delivery. Optimization where mostly on the performance side of things.</description>

      <description>For Vogsy I developed several intergrations in CRMs (Hubspot, Salesforce &amp;amp; Copper) and financial applications (Quickbooks, Exact &amp;amp; Xero). I also provided a base for a Zapier application that lets users automate things together with Vogsy.
All API integrations where build with Python on App Engine. For each integration a seperate integration layer is build with full test-coverage. The architecture is based on Domain Driven Design (DDD).</description>

      <guid>https://jplattel.nl/post/2020-01-29-upymenu-lcd-micropython-menu/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve published my first library to PyPi! It is a simple utility function you can use in micropython to build menus for LCD displays. I was used to the Liquid Crystal and Liquid Menu while developing on an Arduino.
When I made the switch towards micropython I saw no such thing existed. But having a statemachine like menu is quite easy in Python and I wanted to abstract it a bit into a library, this way it is easier to use for other people!</description>

      <description>Inspired by a few blogs that I follow I wanted to share my current setup for Python projects that I use personally. This setup might vary based on clients that I have, but for my own projects this is what I mostly use:
 iTerm, zsh &amp;amp; oh-my-zsh with my own coloured theme. VSCode, with the following plugins:  Python for VSCode autopep8 Bracket pair colorizer 2 Indent rainbow Git Lens   Virtualenv (with virtualenvwrapper)  All environments are saved in the ~/.</description>

      <description>For Nolostcapital I build a tool that lets them put out questionnaires for specific goals towards well-being and HR. The tool offers direct insights from all the results from those questionnaires, enabling organizations to quickly act.
The backend service was done in python &amp;amp; Django and the front-end in Vue.</description>

      <description>To enable target marketing towards startups and investors alike, I helped Fundsup create a single database for campaigns and meta-data for their platform. The main technology of this stack was python &amp;amp; Django for the backend and the API and Vue for the front-end. The database was PostGres with JSON fields allowing for querying non-schema based fields.</description>

      <description>In two weeks I created the first REST API for a chatbot service that Watermelon is offering to their clients.
Once I got started I also converted their current stack to support Docker &amp;amp; implemented an auth gateway that would take in older auth flows and support better authentication for the API. The API was build in python &amp;amp; Django with Django Rest Framework (DRF)</description>

      <description>Together with Colliers we created the Quantified Workplace, an experiment in which we tracked physical activity, heart-rate, computer usage, productivity and personal scores troughout the day. This data was collected in a dashboard that would enable employees to discover insights about their health and well-being during the workday.
During the entire year of tracking Phoebe V. Moore as researcher investigated the impact of the platform.
As for the technology stack, custom API&amp;rsquo;s for interfacing with different trackers were all built with Python and the main dashboard is based on Django.</description>

      <description>Based on LinkedIn data, I created insights for The Ministry of the Interior. Each year over 200 trainees are joining the government and their skills can be employed more wisely and based on interest next to experience from the traineeship itself.
My work consisted out of gathering the data, visualisation and future strategy on how to match talent within the government. Most work is done in Python and Jupyter notebooks as the technology stack.</description>

      <description>I am an avid user of shortcuts and like to improve my workflow and I would like to discover hidden patterns. This is what happens next. When I bought my Mac 2 months ago I dumped my mouse in favor of the trackpad. Did this influence my mouse/trackpad interaction? Sadly I can&amp;rsquo;t draw any conclusions about it because I switched my operating system too!
However more recently I started using MacLogger and together with Jelle I&amp;rsquo;ve made some custom python and processing scripts that should offer more insight into my mouse usage.</description>

      <title>GeoTracking: streaming GPS locations</title>
      <link>https://jplattel.nl/post/2010-08-31-geotracking-streaming-gps-locations/</link>

      <guid>https://jplattel.nl/post/2010-08-31-geotracking-streaming-gps-locations/</guid>
      <description>I am trying to publish my blogposts in English to reach a wider public. However since English is my second language please forgive me my spelling errors.
Since reading about self-tracking I was fascinated by GPS location and geospatial analysis. As it turns out …. experiments had been done before and I wanted to experience what you could do with the data.
  I wondered if it were possible for me recreate this, using my less then basic programming skills and no more utilities then my iPhone.</description>
