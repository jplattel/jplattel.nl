      <description>This blogpost mostly functions as a reminder to myself on how to configure Mainsail to use Zerotier. If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with any of the two, the first one is a operating system made for running a 3D printer and the second one allows for a network layer for personal computing, connecting devices over SD-WAN &amp;amp; VPN.
I was running Octoprint for a while, but after a tip by David from Dato I went on to explore Mainsail.</description>

      <description>Boredom is something we all experience in different ways. And the solution isnâ€™t always that easy. You might dwell for a certain amount of time on the couch.. Or restless as you are think about thinks you might want to do, but they never seem to come up.
I think a certain part boredom is necessary to facilitate ideas and other serendipitous discoveries. However there might be times, in which you would like for the pure boredom to disappear.</description>
