      <description>In the first part, I looked at the frame/enclosure for everything that we need to automate my own brewery. In this part I wanted to show which parts are on the inside based functionality. but first a picture of the enclosure while it&amp;rsquo;s being build:
The enclosure contains the following things:
 Backside:  230V IN: Voltage in, the main power supply for all devices in the enclosure 230V OUT: Switched by the solid state relay based on the PID algorithm RJ12 Female connecter: Input for the temperature sensor that is used by the PID algorithm as input   Frontside:  Traffic-light interface: lights to indicate what is on.</description>

      <description>As an avid home-brewer I own a setup that I use for testing out recipes and recreating my favorite beers with my own twist. Over the last years, my gear has improved a bit and one of my main projects is automating my own brewery. I wanted to document this, so maybe other people could use this as well.
My brewing system consists of a Brew in a Bag (BIAB) system, build on a modified Weck-kettle.</description>

      <description>Past week we spend a day at a brewery! We made a new batch for our brewery Nooitgedacht. We improved our recipe of our tripel and you can now fund our brewery buy pre-ordering a crate of beer trough Kratfunding, we only ship to the Netherlands currently!
Our plan is to use Kratfunding in a way to organise enough money to be self-sufficient as a brewery. And as an organization we want to enable more homebrewers to scale up more easily.</description>

      <description>And it&amp;rsquo;s beer! Well it&amp;rsquo;s stored now and bubbling away! Yesterday afternoon I&amp;rsquo;ve brewed my first batch of beer. With the gear and knowledge of a friend, we manufactured 48 liters of pale ale. The sunny afternoon also was a perfect opportunity for my new camera, so I took some tests shots. Here&amp;rsquo;s the brewery in my backyard:
The recipe we decided on included star-anise and lemongrass. Sadly the coriander seeds got lost and we skipped those.</description>
