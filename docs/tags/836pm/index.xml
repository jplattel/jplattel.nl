      <description>Long overdue, and it&amp;rsquo;s missing more photos then I&amp;rsquo;d like, here&amp;rsquo;s the 8:36pm video of 2021! Thanks to Quinten Swagerman with helping out making it into a video! (Switching to a new mac broke the old After Effects I was still using&amp;hellip;)

      <description>As 2020 is over and 2021 is just beginning I once return to the yearly habits that I&amp;rsquo;ve grown into doing. One of them is completing the Year Compass together with my girlfriend. To other was stuck for a while to the fact that OS X Catalina only supports 64 bit applications, which sucks if you run an outdated version of After Effects.
I had to ask my brother to render the yearly movie of all my 8:36pm photos and thankfully he did, so without further ado, here it is:</description>

      <description>Today marks something special. Ten years ago, inspired by Buster Benson I started taking a picture at 8:36pm every day. A simple thing you might think, but in the end I kept doing it and to this day I still do.
Keeping a habit for 10 years makes it a bit extraordinairy and I can say I will continue taking a picture! Below you will find this years movie of all the photos I took.</description>
