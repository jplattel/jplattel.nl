      <description>&lt;p&gt;Slowly but surely I&amp;rsquo;m making progress on my personal project. Creating a wearable keyboard that can be used while walking has been a dream of mine for a couple of years. One of the decision I made upfront is that I makes no sense to rush this project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main reason is that most of the stuff I create these days either have to be brought to market as soon as possible (by yesterday please!). The other reason is that cutting corners for such a unique problem I try to solve results into missing certain details or solutions that might not be obvious at first sight. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is going to be a product, I do try to learn on how to design for manufacturing. Thanks to the wonderful folks at &lt;a href=&#34;http://dato.mu/&#34;&gt;Dato&lt;/a&gt; as sparring partners. There&amp;rsquo;s just soo much to learn when developing something from scratch with no previous examples or solutions available&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
