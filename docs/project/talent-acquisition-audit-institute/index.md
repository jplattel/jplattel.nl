With [Bas van de Haterd](https://vandehaterd.nl/en/) and [Rikkert Walbeek](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/rikkertwalbeek) we started the [Talent Acquisition Audit Institute](https://ta-audit.com) (TA Audit for short). Our goal is to create bias-free recruitment processes by auditing companies and their talent acquisition.

>   An equal opportunity for everyone to find a job regardless of age, originethnicity or gender, that is our mission. We do this by conducting independent audits and awarding the Bias Free Hiring quality mark.
    There is a lot of attention to diversity and inclusion in the Recruitment and HR profession, and yet (un)conscious bias remains a major problem in selection processes. By providing insight into existing bias and its effect, we enable organizations to reduce bias and offer fair opportunities, resulting in the Bias-Free Hiring quality mark.
