With our [brewery](http://brouwerijnooitgedacht.nl/) we have to deal with inventory & supplies. To solve this I had to build my own solution, thus [Organization.supply](https://organization.supply) was born. 

This Django/python application solves the inventory problems for us. It's not in active development at this moment as it suits most of our needs from the brewery.
