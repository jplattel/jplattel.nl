You can [order one](https://shop.ovklok.nl/) if you live in the Netherlands and use public transport a lot from a specific location. The enclosure is made by pressure-forming plastic in the [Mayku Multiplier](https://mayku.me/multiplier) and a 3D print allowing for different methods of mounting and freestanding use.

The ESP32 runs on Circuit Python and is fully configurable with a USB-C cable through the browser with the use of WebSerial. This skips troublesome setups like captive portals or file editing. It's a simple and calm device allowing you to catch your public transport right on time!
