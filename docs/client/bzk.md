Based on LinkedIn data, I created insights for The Ministry of the Interior. Each year over 200 trainees are joining the government and their skills can be employed more wisely and based on interest next to experience from the traineeship itself. 

My work consisted out of gathering the data, visualisation and future strategy on how to match talent within the government. Most work is done in _Python_ and Jupyter notebooks as the technology stack.
