[Sovn](https://getsovn.com/) (previously known as Jawsaver) creates smart earbuds to stop teeth grinding & clenching. Bruxism is a problem and to solve that I was asked to create several prototypes of mechanics to see what's the most interesting strategy to develop into a product. 

All prototypes where supported with a dynamic earbud platform that let's a user test different mechanics. Arduino's, micropython, 3D printing and rapid prototyping are things that we're used in this development proces.

Working with Sovn / Jawsaver resulted in a [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2023099429A1/) for jaw movement tracking.
