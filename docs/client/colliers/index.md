Together with Colliers we created the Quantified Workplace, an experiment in which we tracked physical activity, heart-rate, computer usage, productivity and personal scores troughout the day. This data was collected in a dashboard that would enable employees to discover insights about their health and well-being during the workday.

During the entire year of tracking [Phoebe V. Moore](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/business/people/academic/phoebe-moore) as researcher investigated the impact of the platform. 

As for the technology stack, custom API's for interfacing with different trackers were all built with _Python_ and the main dashboard is based on _Django_.
