For digital fitness (Digitale Fitheid in dutch) I've created a questionnaire where people can discover how well versed they are with technology and digital tools. The small test is developed in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) & run on AWS with [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) / [Chalice](https://aws.github.io/chalice/index.html) as a backend.
