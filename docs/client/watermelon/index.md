In two weeks I created the first REST API for a chatbot service that Watermelon is offering to their clients. 

Once I got started I also converted their current stack to support Docker & implemented an auth gateway that would take in older auth flows and support better authentication for the API. The API was build in _python_ & _Django_ with Django Rest Framework (DRF)
