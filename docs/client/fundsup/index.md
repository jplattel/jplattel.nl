To enable target marketing towards startups and investors alike, I helped Fundsup create a single database for campaigns and meta-data for their platform. The main technology of this stack was _python_ & _Django_ for the backend and the API and _Vue_ for the front-end. The database was PostGres with JSON fields allowing for querying non-schema based fields.
