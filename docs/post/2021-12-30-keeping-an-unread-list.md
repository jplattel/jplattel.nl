For all the things I organize, inbox zero might just be one of the biggest achievements. Frequently less then 5 emails are in my inbox and every day I work, the todo-list shrinks. But there's one list that keeps on growing, and that's my read it later list in [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/).

For years I've been collecting stuff I read and find on the internet. Mostly due to my newsletter, [The Curious Corner of the Internet](https://curiouscorner.nl/), but also to keep a list of things to inspire me and discover again at a later stage... For years I've been trying to empty out that list during a holiday, but I never managed to...

And then it hit me, this list is never meant to be emptied. It should be much like the [anti-library of Umberto Eco](https://fs.blog/the-antilibrary/), or `La biblioteca de Babel` from [Borges](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Library_of_Babel). I was aiming for a sense of accomplishment while trying to read all the things in my read it later list. As the name implies, you should read it later. But I realized that it doesn't work that way for me.

**The read it later list is a place, not a list that needs to be emptied**. A place that could serve inspiration, connect random things together or combine random items to foster ideas. An emergency room for the mind, as stated in [this article](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/amman-jordan-24-hour-bookstore) (which I found in my list, ha!). And while Pocket never meant it this way, I think it would be interesting to develop some new interface for this use.
