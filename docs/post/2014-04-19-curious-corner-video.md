I've curated 6 editions of [the Curious Corner of the Internet](http://jplattel.nl/corner) until this day. It started out as an experiment of just showing my saved-for-later links in a presentation. The newsletter essentially was a second format, and I didn't explore my chances for a talk much further. Until now, during the Week for the Entrepreneur in the Netherlands, that I'd give it another shot. Sadly, it's in dutch, but here's the video:

Thanks to [Daan](http://www.videologic.nl/) for the video. The next talk might be at [Permanent Beta day](http://www.meetup.com/PermanentBeta/events/162113042/) on the 30th of June.
