Software is not all there is, I'm diving into hardware! For the last month a lot of electronics have passed my hands, including [sensors](http://op-innovations.com), arduinos and others. I've been given a [Makey Makey](http://www.makeymakey.com) by [Loes](http://loesberkhout.nl/) and now doing a hardware project in collaboration with [Setup](http://setup.nl) and it involves this big red button.

I'll try my best to keep you posted of my hardware adventures!
