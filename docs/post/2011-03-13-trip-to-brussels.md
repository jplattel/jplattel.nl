This week I travelled to Brussels so I could give a talk at the [Quantified Self Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Quantified-Self-Show-Tell-Brussels/) group there. And I've been involved in the startup [Scanadu](http://twitter.com/scanadude) which is about broadcasting your health. Together with people like [Walter de Brouwer](http://twitter.com/#!/walterdebrouwer) and [Misha Chellam](http://twitter.com/#!/mishachellam) we are going to take a different approach to health. During my stay in Brussels I've learned a lot (including my level of French, it's really bad!). Really liked the city though!

So onto the Quantified Self Brussels meetup: My talk was about my own small experiments like the mouse patterns and data-portability(which is an important issue). The other talks are listed on the meetup group. I taped the talks, but sadly only 2 are sufficient quality: the talks from [Candide Kemmler](http://twitter.com/#!/ckemmler) and Ben Senior.

I'll upload them later this week when my brother has some time to make a leader for both video's. I really enjoyed taking the stage about a familiar subject with an interested public and got some great compliments about my talk because english isn't my native language. Also great drinks and discussions afterwards! I've made a [Lifelapse](http://www.thelifelapseexperiment.com/) which I should upload as well.

I really liked the trip to Brussels! And a big thanks for Misha for having a place to stay for me!
