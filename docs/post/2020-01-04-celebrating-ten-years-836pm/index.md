_Today marks something special_. Ten years ago, inspired by [Buster Benson](https://busterbenson.com/) I started taking a picture at **8:36pm every day**. A simple thing you might think, but in the end I kept doing it and to this day I still do. 

Keeping a habit for 10 years makes it a bit extraordinairy and I can say I will continue taking a picture! Below you will find this years movie of all the photos I took. And if you want to have a look at all the videos, checkout this [Vimeo collection](https://vimeo.com/showcase/6688367).

If you're on one of the photos, thanks for being part of this adventure!
