At the third [Quantified Self Conference](http://quantifiedself.com/conference/Palo-Alto-2012/) in Stanford last week I gave a talk about Plugin Heuristcs, a term that describes something I've come across during my years of self-tracking experiments. 

Plugin Heuristics confines an architecture that I propose for self-tracking things with a side-effect. For example when tracking my food intake for at least a month, it changed the way my brain remembers all the things I've eaten. When I got started I could barely remember one day of intake, when a month has passed, your memory for food specific things increases to almost a week.

The slides illustrate some of the things I wanted to talk about, but the main question here is: did you experience the same or other side-effects? If so, how could you put this to use?
