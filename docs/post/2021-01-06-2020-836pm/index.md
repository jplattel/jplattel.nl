As 2020 is over and 2021 is just beginning I once return to the yearly habits that I've grown into doing. One of them is completing the [Year Compass](https://yearcompass.com/) together with my girlfriend. To other was stuck for a while to the fact that OS X Catalina only supports 64 bit applications, which sucks if you run an outdated version of After Effects. 

I had to ask my [brother](https://ikbenke.es) to render the yearly movie of all my 8:36pm photos and thankfully he did, so without further ado, here it is:

Since everybody is creating new year goals and I haven't really done one in the recent years I decided to do it one thing different, I will be spending the entire month of january solely on my own projects, for example the [ANT Pcb Maker](http://localhost:1313/post/2020-05-02-ant-pcb-maker/) or plugins for [Obsidian](http://localhost:1313/tags/obsidian/). As such I will be updating the blog more regularly, so keep an eye out for updates!
