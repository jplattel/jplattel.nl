I'll figured out to publish this, not only for my archives, but also to share some insight into the data that a person could generate. Have a look at the things I'm tracking to function as an archive or feedback loop. If I have some more time, I'll explain the things I use to make this all possible.

*   Distance travelled (which cities did I visit?)
*   Which people do I meet everyday?
*   What projects did I work on? And how much time?
*   How much work got done? (productivity, scale 1-10)
*   How do I physically and mentally? (1-10 scale for both)
*   Top 5 of nice and bad things that happend today
*   General rate of the day (1-10 scale)
*   How much coffee, tea, water etc did I drink (no other food tracking yet)
*   Did I exercise? Is the activity logged by Runkeeper? (speed & GPS)
*   Dreams (not quite everyday but interesting as I'm exploring lucid dreaming)
*   How many hours did I sleep (and how well rested am I each morning?)
*   Take a picture everyday at 8:36pm
*   Daily photo of myself with the Everyday App
*   Reading patterns (mashup through Read It Later list)
*   Software usage with Rescue Time & Wakoopa
*   Casually I track my mouse patterns with MacLogger
*   Lifelapses (only on special events)

_In addition there are other data-stream which can be used for data collection:_

*   Twitter/facebook updates, these contain a lot of useful data, but also much noise
*   Foursquare (really nice to have an archive!)
*   OV-chipkaart (used for public transport in The Netherlands much like the Oyster-card)
*   Payment transactions (Not able yet to transform this to any useful information, but should be shortly)
*   Calendar (not used, but lots of information in it!)
*   Blogposts or other online material like photos with EXIF-data.\
*   Email (text-analysis, mail-count, etc. can be a nice set of data)

And I tried some temporary things to explore, but are discontinued because it takes too much time or effort:

*   750words (I'm not a writer, but a data person)
*   GPS-broadcasting (every 3 minutes, including a live update header that shows my location on my blog)

Things I still would like to try but are to expensive for me at the moment of writing.

*   Zeo (analyzing sleep together with my dream journal)
*   FitBit to get some activity patterns
*   Get my genome analyzed by 23andme
