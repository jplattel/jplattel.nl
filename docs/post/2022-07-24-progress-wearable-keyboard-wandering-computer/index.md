Slowly but surely I'm making progress on my personal project. Creating a wearable keyboard that can be used while walking has been a dream of mine for a couple of years. One of the decision I made upfront is that I makes no sense to rush this project. 

The main reason is that most of the stuff I create these days either have to be brought to market as soon as possible (by yesterday please!). The other reason is that cutting corners for such a unique problem I try to solve results into missing certain details or solutions that might not be obvious at first sight. Even though I'm not sure if this is going to be a product, I do try to learn on how to design for manufacturing. Thanks to the wonderful folks at [Dato](http://dato.mu/) as sparring partners. There's just soo much to learn when developing something from scratch with no previous examples or solutions available...

Anyhow, it's progressing quite well and I'm almost at a stage at which the hardware is finished! For example, the PCB's are looking alright (and I even found some space for my [favorite poem](https://allpoetry.com/All-Watched-Over-By-Machines-Of-Loving-Grace):

I've switched to flat cable connectors for connecting the pcb of the keys to the main board, as well as redesigning the enclosure (not pictured) to fit the top key with a socket so that one can be swapped as well! The band is also placed more comfortable and attached in a different (but more solid way). 

The assembly is also better as you can now put all the parts in the right order into one side and close it off. I still need to find a way to mount the battery in a safe and solid way.

And here's the left hand fully assembled:
