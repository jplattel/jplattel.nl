This picture below might seem blurry to you, and indeed it is, but for me it is a significant picture that reflect 3 years of working behind my computer.

I've been running the [Lifeslice](https://github.com/wanderingstan/Lifeslice) program for over 3 years now and I thought it was about time to do something with it! The picture above is generated with over 4000 webcamshots taken during that time.

There's a trove of other data in too. For example the location of my computer (not necessarily me!) and all screens over time. Have a look at the simple vizualisations I've made:

There's some more data-collection software running on my computer, for example [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/). For now, I would love to have it all in my calendar, but iCal doesn't support feeds with over 4000 items very well...
